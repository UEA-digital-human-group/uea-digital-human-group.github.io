Dr. Sarah Taylor is a Research Fellow in the School of Computing Sciences and leads the Digital Humans Group in the Graphics, Vision and Speech Laboratory. Her research interests concern analysis and synthesis of faces and bodies during speech. She has worked on projects relating to computer lip-reading, automatic redubbing of video and speech-driven facial animation.

Dr. Taylor’s PhD thesis concerned identifying and formally defining units of visual speech to be used for facial animation. During her PhD studies, she completed two internships at Disney Research in Pittsburgh, USA, working on faces and speech. Following her PhD, Dr. Taylor worked as an Associate Research Scientist for two years at Disney Research.

In 2015 Dr. Taylor returned to UEA to establish her own group. In 2017 She became a Lecturer in Computing Science and in 2018 achieved an EPSRC UKRI Innovation Fellowship.

Dr. David Greenwood is a Senior Associate Research Scientist in the School of Computing Sciences and a member of the Digital Humans Group in the Graphics, Vision and Speech Laboratory. Dr Greenwood's research interests involve the modelling of human speech and motion, neural rendering and camera estimation. He has worked with tracking people in video, social interaction in Virtual Environments and speech-driven animation.


Dr. Greenwood’s PhD thesis focused on the rigid pose of the head during speech, using deep learning to predict motion. During his PhD studies, he completed two internships, first at Disney Research in Pittsburgh, and later at Oculus Research (now Facebook Reality Labs), also in Pittsburgh.
